# Lightning Exercise One

1.  Create a new dictionary of strings to represent a sandwich. The dictionary should store the follow data:
    - Bread type
    - Price
    - Number of calories
    - A comma-seperated, stringified list of ingridients 


# Lightning Exercise Two
1. In `Program.cs`, create a new class that represents a customer at the sandwich shop
2. Give the customer the following public properties:
    - FirstName (string)
    - LastName (string)
    - RewardPoints (int)
    - Email (string)
3. In the `Main()` method of your `Program` class, create a list of customers.
4. Print each customer's first name and last name to the console. 

(Instructor note: when you go over this, give the customer a favorite sandwich)

# Lightning Exercise Three
1. Add a method to your customer class called `AddRewardPoints`. This method should accept a parameter of the number of reward points the customer earned (an `int`) and add it to the customers `RewardPoints` property. Then it should write to the console the new value of the customer's `RewardPoints`.
