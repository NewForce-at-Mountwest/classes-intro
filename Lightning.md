2. Give the customer the following public properties:
    - FirstName (string)
    - LastName (string)
    - RewardPoints (int)
    - Email (string)
3. In the `Main()` method of your `Program` class, create a list of customers.
4. Print each customer's first name and last name to the console.

Then it should write to the console the new value of the customer's `RewardPoints`.
